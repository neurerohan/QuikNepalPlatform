🎨 Design a clean, modern, and responsive homepage for a Nepali utility platform called **QuikNepal**. The purpose is to provide tools like the Nepali calendar, vegetable rates, metal prices, rashifal, and forex rates — all fetched via a working Django backend.

This design should be visually aesthetic, highly usable on mobile, and convey trust and clarity. DO NOT focus on implementation — only on the UI visuals in Figma or compatible design tools.

🧠 Psychological Notes:
• CTA buttons should stand out with yellow-green accent (`#CDDC39`) — use hover animation (e.g., grow or glow)
• Use a visual hierarchy — large headings, readable spacing, soft background dividers
• Use consistency in spacing: e.g., 24px padding in cards, 16px margin between elements
• Mobile-first design: collapse columns, stack cards, and use hamburger for header nav
